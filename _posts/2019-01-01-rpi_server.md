Implemented a seafile storage, nginx config, MariaDB database, a phpforums site, a wordpress site, a regular html site, a minecraft server, and a browser based web vnc remoting solution into one raspberry pi.

Unfortunately don't have it running due to SD card corruption, but will put it online once I'm able to.
