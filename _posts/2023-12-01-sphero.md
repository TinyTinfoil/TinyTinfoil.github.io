Was responsible for making the charging system of a DIY Sphero for a mechatronics class and helping out on the electronics.
Overall, a very fun project.

Also helped out on the website (the reason why this website looks worse is because I'm using Jekyll and need to care about what GitHub pages is comfortable with).
