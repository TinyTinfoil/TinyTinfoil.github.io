Made semiconductors from scratch, using Whisk drain cleaner to etch wafers and making our own dopants with phosphoric acid and TEOS, plus equipment from the on-campus MatSci lab (tube furnace and hotplates).

Worth noting that this was several months before the ProjectsInFlight video about this subject.
The end result was a working PMOS transistor.
