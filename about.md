### About Me
I'm an experienced coder with (technically) 5 years of experience.
As such, I have expertise in Javascript, Lua, Python, Java, Bash and Linux tools.
I have an understanding of the following: GLSL, WebExtensions, Svelte, Vue, and React.js. This is because much of my experience thus far has been on front-end web development designing sites where I push the limits of what's possible in a static site. I have also worked on projects involving accessible web design. 
I also have relevant experience in Illustrator and Photoshop, and 3d design experience in both Blender and Maya.

My career has taken an interesting turn as now as I'm attending a small engineering school <s>located in the middle of nowhere.</s> Here, I've done work involving sustainability, electrical circuit design, and mechanical design/prototyping.
