I'm an experienced coder with *technically* 10 years of experience (yes, I was one of those kids that started coding at 11).

As such, I have expertise in Javascript, Lua, Python, Java, Bash and Linux tools.
I have an understanding of the following: GLSL, WebExtensions, Svelte, Vue, and React.js. This is because much of my experience thus far has been on front-end web development designing sites where I push the limits of what's possible in a static site. I have also worked on projects involving accessible web design. 
I also have relevant experience in Illustrator and Photoshop, and 3D design experience in both Blender and Maya.

My career has taken an interesting turn as now as I'm attending a [small engineering school](https://olin.edu) <s>located in the middle of nowhere.</s> Here, I've done work involving sustainability, electrical circuit design, and mechanical design/prototyping. I've grown a particularly fond interest in semiconductors and new analog technologies.

I've done some work at the ADE Global Health group and at Second Order Effects for extremely low noise analog signal chains.

I'm also taking some psychology courses at [Wellesley College](https://wellesley.edu). That's kind of a long story.
