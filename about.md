I'm an experienced coder with *technically* 10 years of experience (yes, I was one of those kids that started coding at 11).

As such, I have expertise in Javascript, Lua, Python, C#, Java, Bash and Linux tools.
I have an understanding of the following: GLSL, WebExtensions, Svelte, Vue, and React.js. This is because much of my experience thus far has been on front-end web development designing sites where I push the limits of what's possible in a static site. I have also worked on projects involving accessible web design.

I've been fortunate to have an early start in coding and system development due to having access to low cost and accessible tech through the [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.com) and [Netduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netduino) projects, for which I am eternally grateful to the many contributors ahd their hard work for both of them.

I also have relevant experience in Illustrator and Photoshop, and 3D design experience in both Blender and Maya.

My career has taken an interesting turn as I'm now attending a [small engineering school](https://olin.edu) <s>located in the middle of nowhere.</s>

Here, I've done work involving sustainability and medical devices, electrical circuit design, and mechanical design/prototyping. I've grown a particularly fond interest in semiconductors and new analog technologies, and making them accessible to those starting out in the same ways that the Raspberry Pi and Netduino projects have done.

I've done some work at the ADE Global Health group and at Second Order Effects for extremely low noise analog signal chains.

I've also taken some psychology courses at [Wellesley College](https://wellesley.edu) and [Brandeis University](https://brandeis.edu).

I'm currently looking for opportunities in the semiconductor or semiconductor adjacent space for fall or spring internships for 2025, and/or full time roles or graduate labs doing work in semiconductors starting in 2026.
