  I go by TinyTinfoil on GitHub
</p>
I'm currently hope to grow my experience in mixed signal semiconductors, focusing on emerging technologies such as RRAM and 2D semiconducting materials like CNFETs (these are part of a project that will be released later this year). I bring expertise in mixed signal PCB design and firmware development for ARM microcontrollers, particularly STM32s, through my prior work. In particular, I've worked in scenarios where I've had to chase extremely low noise performance from cost effective manufacturing and parts.

You can find more info about me in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/TinyTinfoil) and [about page](about)
