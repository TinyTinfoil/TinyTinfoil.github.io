You can find more info about me in my <a href="https://github.com/TinyTinfoil">GitHub profile</a>

### About Me
I'm an experienced coder with 5+ years of experience, and I've done hardware work for longer than that. I have expertise in Javascript, Lua, Python, Java, PHP, Windows XP to Windows 10, Bash and Linux (both Debian and in other forms, such as Arch or Gentoo). I have an understanding of the following: GLSL, Pytorch, Godot, Haskell, Rust, Swift, WebExtensions, Svelte, Vue, React, Unity Engine, Unreal Engine, Terragen, Dos and Windows 95-98, Powershell, Lisp, and C#. I'm experienced in server and consumer computer hardware and repair/troubleshooting, including software troubleshooting/repair for Android. I also have a CompTIA A+ certification as a result of my skills, and plan to get Network+ certified later this year. I'm also experienced in setting up neural nets with Tensorflow, but please note that I refuse to work on neural nets (or any development work really) if it goes against the terms in my AI declaration. In terms of front end work, I'm relatively less experienced, but I do have knowledge of HTML, SVG (and SVG in HTML solutions), and CSS, and how to implement these in an accessible webpage. I also have relevent experience in Ilustrator and Photoshop, and 3d design in both Blender and Maya.

*Not taking job offers, check back around June-July*

### My Projects
I'm part of the NHS coding club, and have done several projects with them, such as [making an AI for recyclables classification](https://github.com/NHS-CS-Club/recyclenet).

But besides that, I've done:

* [Musical Pomodoro](https://github.com/TinyTinfoil/Musical-Pomodoro) – An extension for syncing music to a pomodoro timer
* [Deeplink.js](https://github.com/TinyTinfoil/deeplink) – A work in progress JavaScript microframework for reactivity

*I'll likely include a portfolio here with all my 2d and 3d design work, when I'm able to gather everything into one spot*
