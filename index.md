### Hello
<p align="center">
  I go by TinyTinfoil on GitHub

You can find more info about me in my <a href="https://github.com/TinyTinfoil">GitHub profile</a>

*Please note that someone unrelated to me has taken the name tinytinfoil on Twitter. I disapprove of this person's inflammatory and racist statements and wish to reiterate that I am by no means related to them. My personal Twitter handle is @realtinytinfoil and **NOT** tinytinfoil.*

### About Me
I'm an experienced coder with 5+ years of experience, and I've done hardware work for longer than that. I have expertise in Javascript, Lua, Python, Java, PHP, Windows XP to Windows 10, Bash and Linux (both Debian and in other forms, such as Arch or Gentoo). I have an understanding of the following: GLSL, Pytorch, Godot, Haskell, Rust, Swift, WebExtensions, Svelte, Vue, React, Unity Engine, Unreal Engine, Terragen, Dos and Windows 95-98, Powershell, Lisp, and C#. I'm experienced in server and consumer computer hardware and repair/troubleshooting, including software troubleshooting/repair for Android. I hold certifications in these areas. I'm also experienced in setting up neural nets with Tensorflow, but please note that I refuse to work on neural nets (or any development work really) if it has the possibility of misuse by your company or others in ways that would be hard to counter. In terms of front end work, I'm relatively less experienced, but I do have knowledge of HTML, SVG (and SVG in HTML solutions), and CSS, and how to implement these in an accessible webpage. I also have relevant experience in Illustrator and Photoshop, and 3d design in both Blender and Maya.

*Not taking job offers, check back around June-July*

### My Projects
I'm part of the NHS coding club, and have done several projects with them, such as [making an AI for recyclables classification](https://github.com/NHS-CS-Club/recyclenet).

But besides that, I've done:

* [Musical Pomodoro](https://github.com/TinyTinfoil/Musical-Pomodoro) – An extension for syncing music to a pomodoro timer
* [Deeplink.js](https://github.com/TinyTinfoil/deeplink) – A work in progress JavaScript microframework for reactivity

*I'll likely include a portfolio here with all my 2d and 3d design work, when I'm able to gather everything into one spot*

I'm also currently working on a neural text to speech talker designed to work as an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) support for people with difficulty speaking, such as persons with special needs. This project will likely be uploaded by February, once user experience and testing has been finished at The Arc (an organization that supports those with special needs). It will have state-of-the-art voice synthesis that will aim to recreate a person's voice, decreasing the difference between speech abled and speech developing persons.
